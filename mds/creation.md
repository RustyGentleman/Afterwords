# The Defiance of Creation

Though I didn't realize it in clear and explicit terms until my later years, the idea, the concept; the act and art of creation, has always been my biggest passion.

The thought of taking disparate objects, physical and/or conceptual, and working them together into something that is more than their sum.

The thought of something which the existence of, though independent from that of I, is intrinsically tied to it, and that still may exist longer than I.

The act of creation is a big fuck-you to the tyranny of time and entropy, and humanity's greatest gift, and it seems intensely fitting for it to have been my biggest passion in life, as one whose biggest fear was the concept of time itself.

## Drawings

My first acts of creation of art were, naturally, pictures; drawings. I often wished I'd dedicated more time to developing this skill, because of how much easier it is for people to experience. Not everyone plays games, not many have the same tastes and passion for music as I, and even less truly appreciate more nuanced forms of visual art, like design - interior design, webdesign, interface design.

## Music

I've always had a _weird_, special and intense connection to music. At the ending point of my life, some of the reasons were clear:

- As an aspie, having echolalia meant I could, when physically possible, perfectly mimic sounds and sequence of sounds I heard, and that included song vocals and note sequences - an ability which I never managed to fully grasp whether it's considered perfect pitch or not.
- As an aspie, again, my mind seemed _particularly_ well tuned to patterns, including those in music: patterns in and relations between sequences of notes, rhythms and changes in them, line structure and word choice in lyrics.
- Having chronic depression from a young age, music was sometimes the **only way** I had to be in touch with my emotions, as well as to express them, by sharing.

I never had to chance to investigate the neurology of it, but something about the high complexity and rhythmicality of genres like progressive rock and metal, jazz fusion, and baroque classical music, would make **my whole brain** light up like christmas lights, to the point of it being (and I apologize for the arguably crass wording) near-orgasmic.

tacMusic was the __only way I had__ to reliably experience intense positive feelings and emotions for the entirety of my life.
