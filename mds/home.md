This is, in small part, a fuck-you to the world and to time. I was brought to life and kept in it with complete disregard for my will, and forced to accept that leaving in my own terms would have consequences for those I love. So here it is: I hereby declare myself, in some way, deceased. Fuck you.

In a much bigger part, however, this is meant to be a posthumously developed archive of much that had, in life, kept me from leaving it. Creative projects, musings, ideas; little pieces of my consciousness that I'd like to leave here. To imprint upon you. Yes, my hope is that, in some way, a part of me will still be alive, like some sort of zombie, in the minds of you, both singular and plural.

Though I didn't realize it in clear and explicit terms until my later years, the idea, the concept, the act and art of creation, has always been one of my biggest passions. The thought of something existing, that didn't before, because of me. The thought that it'll still exist when I don't.

Not just a worldbuilding and writing project, but an entire world I've built inside my head; the apex of my desire and drive to _create_.

##> Games

Games and/or _game-like_ things I've developed; mostly small in scale. Yes, I'm putting them under creative

##> Music

Songs, patterns, progressions, explorations... I really wish I'd gotten at least some basic training in life.

Some weird little projects, mostly just for experience and proof of concepts.

Would-be letters to those whose existences I've touched in some manner.
