# Music

A collection of original songs, acapella covers, by-ear/from-memory remakes of songs, and other snippets of bullshit I've accumulated. Some of them I'm quite proud, some are just snippets of ideas that I never quite got to finishing, and others are just, again, snippets of bullshit.

...Can't believe this is something I actually need to do, but I do not consent to any of these recordings being used to train generative AI of any sort, for any reason. If, however, you wanna sample something or try to fully realized some of my half-baked ideas, fuck it, go for it; just attribute it to me and, if possible, link back here.

## Originals

More or less serious attempts at making what sounds like an actual song. Some of them I'm fairly proud of, others I wish I had better expertise to properly make, or better tools and more knowledge on how to work them.

## Remakes

Existing songs I, for one reason or another, wanted to try and remake by ear, or from memory. A couple (especially the ones by Home) were from memory, as an attempt to remember what songs they actually were.

## Bits

Experiments, little progressions or beats; that sort of thing.

## Acapella

Buried at the end because I never got formal training and I'm self-conscious. A couple of these I'm rather okay with being heard, however. Others are obviously more on the silly side; no comment on those. For reasons of legality, I was sober and in sound mind during all of these recordings, and no one can or is willing to prove otherwise.
